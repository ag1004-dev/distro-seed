        help
          Pre-built binary blob for making bootable SD/eMMC devices.

          This is based on the 2014.10 U-Boot release which requires
          an older gcc 4.4 compiler which is not possible to build
          in modern Buildroot release. In order to still support this
          platform, this package provides a binary used as part of the
          final image build.

          THIS IS REQUIRED FOR A BOOTABLE TS-7670 IMAGE!
